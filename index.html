  <h1 id="title">SASS</h1>
  	<h3 id="article">In this page, I am going to explain about SASS. From what I learnt, SASS is an abbreviation for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet. It is used as an extension to CSS and enabled people to customize their webpage easier but bigger because it lets you use some things that is not available to be used in CSS yet. However, SASS is not completely without flaws. That is why it is important to understand the basic of CSS before we use SASS. SASS uses its own file name extension which is “.scss”. In order to use SASS, we need to have SASS pre-processor to convert SASS code into standard CSS because browser cannot understand the code. </h3>
